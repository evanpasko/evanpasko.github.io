          <p>Volleyball has been an incredible outlet for me. It introduced me to new friends in all phases of life, and has been a great lesson in perserverance - mainly because
            I was terrible for longer than I'd care to admit. For indoor, I started as a middle blocker, and moved to the pin. Mostly opposite (right side) at first, but as I started 
            to get better at passing I was allowed to play outside. I essentially just play anywhere I get to swing at the ball. On the sand, I tend to be the big, and prefer the right side.

            Before volleyball, I practiced martial arts from the ages of 4 to 18. This was certainly one of the more formative
            experiences of my childhood. It taught me discipline, respect, and perserverance in addition to self defense. It also taught
            me what it meant to be respected by others, and how to behave accordingly when assuming the role of mentor instead of mentee. 
            In my martial arts career, I earned my second degree black belt, taught at all age and skill levels, performed in demonstrations
            at local events to San Diego, and competed at local and international competitions.
