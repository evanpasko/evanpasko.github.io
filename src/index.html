									<h3>Professional Life</h3>
									<h4>Growing as an Engineer Post-Grad</h4>
									<p>After graduating from MIT in 2021 with Bachelors Degree in Aerospace Engineering, a minor in Computer Science, and an Acting HASS (Humanities Arts and Social Science) concentration, I moved to LA
										to work at the Aerospace Corporation. Here, I found myself at home in the Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Ecosystem Laboratory (CAVE Lab), where I spent most of my working hours programming robotics
										hardware to reflect satellite space flight to enable myself and my team to develop hardware and software to support Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO), In-orbit Servicing and Manufacturing (ISAM), and Space Mobility and Logistics (SM&L).
									</p>
									<p>
										These fields of space vehicle mission operations all involve close-proximity (1-10 meter) satellite maneuvers, which require high precision and autonomous control due to telemetry delays in control signals from the ground.
										In the space industry, there is currently a large market to apply AI, ML, RL, Computer Vision, and other modern software technologies to these problems to place trustworthy autonomous agents in orbit.
										My work in the CAVE Lab has furthered almost every aspect of our ability to test these software and hardware tools on the ground before sending them into space, which has a plethora of benefits for companies and researchers hoping to fly vehicles in the aforementioned mission areas.

												<h4>Flight hardware in the Aerospace Corporation's CAVE Lab</h4>
												<p>Working on a wide variety of hardware and software platforms in the lab has been a core part of my experience at Aerospace. A unique experience I gained, depicted on the left, has been closing the loop of robotic motion
													with flight-like hardware. Using Attitude Control Boards (ACBs) or computer vision payloads from the Aerospace Corporations cubesat missions has been an eye opening experience in understanding the rigorous V&V needed of flight-ready system.

												<h4>Developing Control Solutions for Overactuated Mobile Manipulator</h4>
												<p>The robotic platform shown here is the latest hardware aquisition of the CAVE Lab's Neutral Buoyancy Testbed. As demand for our lab increases, so does the workspace in which 
													we need our robots to operate in. I am leading an effort to develop novel control algorithms to enable this mobile manipulator with its mounted mock-satellite to emulate multi-satellite
													mission scenarios operating up to the 10 meter relative distance range.

									<h3>Personal Life</h3>
									<p>
										In my free time, I find myself cycling between my favorite hobbies. Similar to my work-style, I love to pursue many things at once - the more stimulation the merrier!
										Recently, I seem to spend the majority of my time on art, sports, friends, and home projects. 
									</p>
										<h4>Home Projects</h4>
											<h5>Raspberry Pi Server</h5>
												<p>Spending Christmas money on single board computers is a privilege. I recently purchased a Raspberry Pi 5 to begin working on my own pi cluster. Currently, I have
													a working recursive DNS server for ad-blocking and more secure home internet. I am currently working to host my own VPN for future home projects.
												</p>
												<p>My long-term vision for these servers is to create a robotics, AI, and ML development server that I can access remotely and use as a work horse to begin experimenting
													with my own innovations in the respective fields. Particularly, I'm interested in soft robotics, and would like to be able to run FEA on autonomous, compliant robotic systems
													using non-metal effectors and manipulators to interact with the world. I believe that this is the ultimate solution to collaborative robotics. Big Hero 6 had a good point. 
												</p>
											<h5>Custom 3DoF Robot Arm</h5>
												<p>I am currently working on building my own 3 joint robot simulation from scratch to better understand the fundamental principles of robotic control, kinematics,
													and simulation frameworks
												</p>

										<h4>Art</h4>
											<p>I have been interested in visual art my entire life. From proportedly drawing fingers and toes on my stick figures in preschool, to taking advanced art courses
												in high school and college, I have tried my best to keep this passion alive. I primarily use charcoals and water colors, as I find them to be the easiest to travel with.
												When I first moved to New York, I lost this hobby to time better spent catching up with friends I hadn't lived near in years. However, as I slowly socially retire I sought
												out the pretty scenery of the city's parks, museums, and skylines. I have a pocket sketchbook and simple charcoal set that I bring with me along my adventures in the city. 
												Because it's small, I am able to quickly draw something in just the right amount of detail, where I can't get lost in my perfectionist tendencies, but I can still explore 
												intricate values and volumes.
											</p>

										<h4>Sports</h4>
											<p>Growing up, I played any sports that my parents signed me up for. It just so happened I got signed up for a lot of them! I played volleyball in high school and college,
												so that is certainly my sport of choice, but I also ski, surf, play in recreational softball leagues, lift weights, rock climb, and run. 
											</p>
											<p>Volleyball has been an incredible outlet for me. It introduced me to new friends in all phases of life, and has been a great lesson in perserverance - mainly because
												I was terrible for longer than I'd care to admit. For indoor, I started as a middle blocker, and moved to the pin. Mostly opposite (right side) at first, but as I started 
												to get better at passing I was allowed to play outside. I essentially just play anywhere I get to swing at the ball. On the sand, I tend to be the big, and prefer the right side. 
												If you're looking for a partner, don't be afraid to reach out!
