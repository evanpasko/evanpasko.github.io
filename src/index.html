									<h3>Professional Life</h3>
									<h4>Growing as an Engineer Post-Grad</h4>
									<p>After graduating from MIT in 2021 with Bachelors Degree in Aerospace Engineering, a minor in Computer Science, and an Acting HASS (Humanities Arts and Social Science) concentration, I moved to LA
										to work at the Aerospace Corporation. 
									</p>
									<h4>The Aerospace Corporation</h4>
									<p>
										Here, I found myself at home in the Collaborative Autonomous Vehicle Ecosystem Laboratory (CAVE Lab), where I spent most of my working hours programming robotics
										hardware to reflect satellite space flight to enable myself and my team to develop hardware and software to support Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO), In-orbit Servicing and Manufacturing (ISAM), and Space Mobility and Logistics (SM&L).

									<h3>Personal Life</h3>
									<p>
										In my free time, I find myself cycling between my favorite hobbies. Similar to my work-style, I love to pursue many things at once - the more stimulation the merrier!
										Recently, I seem to spend the majority of my time on art, sports, friends, and home projects. 
									</p>
										<h4>Home Projects</h4>
										<p>I am currently working towards building my technical knowledge outside of work by spinning up my own home server
											and designing, simulating, and programming my own virtual robot arm. These projects are helping fill some educational gaps
											from not getting my masters degree.
										</p>
										<ul class="actions fit">
											<li><a href="pages/projects.html" class="button primary">Read more</a></li>
										</ul>
											

										<h4>Art</h4>
											<p>I have been interested in visual art my entire life. From proportedly drawing fingers and toes on my stick figures in preschool, to taking advanced art courses
												in high school and college, I have tried my best to keep this passion alive. 
											</p>
											<ul class="actions fit">
												<li><a href="pages/art.html" class="button primary">Read more</a></li>
											</ul>

										<h4>Sports</h4>
											<p>Growing up, I played any sports that my parents signed me up for. It just so happened I got signed up for a lot of them! I played volleyball in high school and college,
												so that is certainly my sport of choice, but I also ski, surf, play in recreational softball leagues, lift weights, rock climb, and run.
