# Notes from Website Setup

## Following install instructions

To setup the website developoment environment, I followed the instructions per Alonzo Lopez's Github-hosted website, [here](https://github.com/alonzolopez/alonzolopez.github.io). One thing I had issues with while I was setting up the website was managing the native ruby install on macbooks, and pointing my system to the correct installation of ruby.

In the ruby install portion of the instructions, if you get to the portion of the instructions that have you check the ruby version using `ruby -v` and get a version `<=2.7`, then I find it better to follow [these directions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) for setting things up.
